# About

Hey, I'm Chris.

I spent my early twenties on the ramp at MSP, keeping tired 727s flying through Minnesota winters on midnight shifts. That's where I learned that everything is fixable if you're stubborn enough and willing to work in the cold.

Now I'm a manufacturing engineer in the medical device world — FDA regulations, validation protocols, and the kind of precision that doesn't leave room for "close enough." By night, I write code. React Native apps, AWS infrastructure, homelab experiments, websites (you're looking at one), and whatever else I can't stop tinkering with.

On weekends, I race motorcycles. Central Road Racing here in Minnesota, number 106, Ultralight and Middleweight classes, five years in. A 2014 KX450F for supermoto and a 2009 ZX6R that I've rebuilt more times than I'll admit.

Same approach to all of it — take it apart, figure out how it works, make it better.

Thanks for stopping by.
