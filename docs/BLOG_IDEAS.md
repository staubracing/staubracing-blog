# Blog Ideas

## Publishing Cadence

**Current goal:** Biweekly posts for 8 weeks, then weekly.

**Category rotation:**
1. **Racing** — race reports, bike updates, track day recaps
2. **Code/Projects** — tutorials, project updates, dev logs
3. **Life** — stories, reflections, career
4. **Wild card** — anything that fits

**Quick start:** Use the `/new-post` skill to scaffold a new post with proper frontmatter and image folder.
