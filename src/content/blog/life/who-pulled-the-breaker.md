The mid-2000s feel like another lifetime now — when Champion Air still flew vacation charters and Kevin, my partner in crime, and I were keeping tired 727s moving at MSP.

Yet another midnight shift on the cold ramp at Minneapolis–Saint Paul International Airport — or as we knew it, simply MSP. Third shift started at nine and, if we were lucky, ended around nine the next morning, but usually dragged closer to ten. The air smelled of jet fuel and exhaust, the kind of cold that made metal sting when you touched it.

I started every night the same way — park outside the hangar, pull my collar up against the wind, and walk through the side door into the little office in back where the coffee pot hissed and the night's task sheets waited. The place always smelled like burnt grounds, cold air, and hydraulic fluid. That's where I grabbed my assignment and found out what kind of trouble I'd be babysitting till sunrise.

Kevin — or K-Dog, as everyone called him — was a farmer from International Falls, Minnesota. He had that mechanical sense you only get when things break forty miles from the nearest toolbox. Out in the fields, if a tractor quit, you didn't call for parts — you made it work with what you had. That mindset followed him onto the ramp. He lived on Mountain Dew and Copenhagen, swore at airplanes like they could hear him, and somehow kept them in the air. Give him a problem, a crescent wrench, and a bad idea, and he'd have that piece of shit running again before sunrise.

That night, we drew a 727-200 with an erratic fuel-flow issue — easy job, just messy as hell sometimes. We loaded the truck with toolboxes, a spare transmitter, and our standard survival kit — coffee strong enough to strip paint, a couple bottles of Mountain Dew, and enough smokes to fog the hangar. The dashboard was a mess of logbooks, menthol cigarettes, and empty Copenhagen cans sliding around as we bounced across the ramp toward the airplane.

Kevin killed the engine and popped the door.

"You grab the transmitter?" he asked, already knowing I had.
"No, I left it at the hangar, dumbass," I shot back. "Of course I grabbed it."
He just grinned — the kind of grin that said _same shit, different night_.

The talk was always rough, the kind of banter you'd hear in a kitchen at rush hour. Outsiders might've thought we hated each other, but it was the opposite. That back-and-forth was respect in our world, a bond built from too many long nights and close calls. You could trust a guy who'd call you an that would make a sailor blush and still hand you the wrench before you asked.

We hauled our toolboxes down, boots crunching on ice and grit, the smell of jet fuel thick enough to taste. Somewhere off in the distance an APU whined, a reminder that the rest of the airport was still alive and moving freight while we froze our asses off
K-Dog and I were usually the problem solvers — the ones called when something refused to cooperate. The rest of the overnight work fell to a gang of contractors from the, at-the-time, bankrupt Sun Country Airlines. They handled the basic checks — periodic service inspections, PS checks, the routine stuff. Good enough hands, but they didn’t know our airplanes the way we did. Every now and then one of them would wander over, eager to “help,” and that’s usually when the fun began.

I pulled the truck under the number-three engine and started opening the cowlings, digging in. Each of our trucks had what we called surfboards on top — steel platforms welded to the bed and frame that stretched out over the cab of the old GMC 1500 Sierras. They were built for reaching the engines and gave us just enough height to work without dragging out a maintenance stand. It wasn’t fancy, but it got the job done.

I was halfway through pulling panels when I spotted some movement out of the corner of my eye. One of the Sun Country contractors was circling the aircraft, clipboard in hand, pretending to look busy. Great, I thought, now I get to help this asshole too. The last thing we needed was another body in the way, especially one who didn’t know our airplane.
