## üîç The Moment of Truth

In Part 1, I left off with the cylinder head coming off and us finally getting our first look at what was really going on inside. Let me tell you - what we found was both exactly what I expected and completely shocking at the same time.

## üí• What We Found

As soon as we lifted the head, the problem was immediately obvious. The #4 cylinder piston had significant damage to the crown. There were deep gouges and what looked like impact marks around the edges. But here's the kicker - the cylinder walls themselves looked surprisingly good.

**The Real Culprit:** After closer inspection, we discovered that the damage wasn't from a catastrophic failure, but from something much more insidious - carbon buildup that had broken loose and gotten trapped between the piston and head.

## üß† Why This Happened

This bike had been running rich for who knows how long before I got it. The previous owner had done some "performance mods" that included a power commander, but the fueling was never properly tuned. Over time, this created excessive carbon buildup in the combustion chambers.

When I started pushing the bike harder on track, the increased heat and pressure caused some of this carbon to break loose. Once it got trapped between the piston and head, it created those distinctive knocking sounds I was hearing.

## üîß The Fix Plan

The good news is that this is totally repairable. Here's what we need to do:

1. **Clean everything thoroughly** - Remove all carbon deposits
2. **Inspect the piston** - Determine if it needs replacement or just cleaning
3. **Check valve seats** - Make sure they're not damaged
4. **Reassemble with proper torque specs**
5. **Address the root cause** - Get the fueling properly tuned

## üí° Lessons Learned

This whole experience taught me a valuable lesson about buying used race bikes. Even if the bike runs well initially, you never know what's lurking beneath the surface. The previous owner's "improvements" actually created the problem that eventually sidelined me.

**Key Takeaway:** Always get a proper tune after any fueling modifications, and don't assume that "it runs fine" means everything is actually fine.

## üõ†Ô∏è Next Steps

In Part 3, I'll walk through the actual repair process - cleaning, inspection, and reassembly. We'll also talk about the fueling setup and how to prevent this from happening again.

Stay tuned for the rebuild process!
