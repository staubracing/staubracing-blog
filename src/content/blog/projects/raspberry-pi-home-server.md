## üéØ Why Build a Home Server?

After years of relying on cloud services for everything, I decided it was time to take back control of my digital life. Between privacy concerns, recurring subscription costs, and the desire to learn more about Linux administration, building a home server became the perfect project.

## üõ†Ô∏è The Hardware Setup

I started with a **Raspberry Pi 4 Model B** (8GB RAM) - the perfect balance of power and affordability. Here's what I paired it with:

- **Storage**: 1TB Samsung T7 SSD (external)
- **Power**: Official Raspberry Pi power supply
- **Case**: Flirc aluminum case for passive cooling
- **Network**: Gigabit Ethernet connection

## üêß Operating System Choice

## üì¶ Essential Services I'm Running

### 1. **Plex Media Server**

- Streams my movie/TV collection to any device
- Automatic metadata fetching
- Hardware transcoding (limited on Pi, but works for 1080p)

### 2. **Nextcloud**

- Personal cloud storage replacement
- File sync across all devices
- Calendar and contact sync

### 3. **Pi-hole**

- Network-wide ad blocking
- DNS server for the entire home network
- Beautiful web interface for monitoring

### 4. **Home Assistant**

- Smart home automation hub
- Integrates with all my IoT devices
- Custom automations for daily routines

## üîß Configuration Highlights

### Docker Setup

```bash
# Install Docker
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
sudo sh get-docker.sh

# Add user to docker group
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

### Automatic Backups

I set up a cron job that creates daily snapshots of my Nextcloud data and syncs them to an external drive.

### Network Configuration

- Static IP assignment
- Port forwarding for external access
- SSL certificates with Let's Encrypt

## üí° Lessons Learned

1. **Start Simple**: Don't try to run everything at once. Add services gradually.
2. **Backup Everything**: RAID isn't backup. Have multiple backup strategies.
3. **Monitor Resources**: The Pi has limits. Keep an eye on CPU, RAM, and storage.
4. **Security First**: Change default passwords, use SSH keys, keep systems updated.

## üöÄ Performance Results

For a $50 computer, I'm amazed at what this little Pi can handle:

- **Plex**: Streams 1080p content to 2-3 devices simultaneously
- **Nextcloud**: Handles file sync for 3 users without breaking a sweat
- **Pi-hole**: Blocks ~30% of DNS requests (ads/tracking)
- **Home Assistant**: Manages 15+ smart devices with complex automations

## üîÆ Future Plans

- Add a second Pi for redundancy
- Implement automated backup verification
- Set up a reverse proxy for better SSL management
- Add monitoring with Grafana/Prometheus

The Raspberry Pi home server has been one of my most rewarding projects. It's taught me so much about Linux administration, networking, and self-hosting. Plus, it's saved me hundreds in subscription fees while giving me complete control over my data.

**Total cost**: ~$150  
**Monthly savings**: ~$25  
**Knowledge gained**: Priceless
