Unfortunately, during the third round of the season—only my second race with the bike—the engine started making a knocking noise during Saturday morning practice.\n\nRight away, I pitted and started trying to figure out what was going on. I fired the bike back up and listened carefully. The noise sounded like a rattle—subtle, but definitely not normal. A few people came over to listen and tossed around their guesses, everything from cam chain rattle to a spun rod bearing. At that point, I knew I had a real problem on my hands, and racing that weekend was off the table.\n\nI'm writing this to share my experience taking on this project—and hopefully motivate someone else to find the confidence to do the same.\n\n## 💬 What Happened / What I Learned\n\nI started with some high-level troubleshooting to figure out what the noise was and where it was coming from. The sound was definitely coming from the right side of the engine, which led me to believe it might be a cam chain issue.\n\nA few people at the track were convinced it was a main rod bearing. But by using the old screwdriver-to-the-ear trick—the classic \"poor man's stethoscope\"—I was able to narrow the noise down to the #4 cylinder area, right around where the cam chain sits.\n\n🛠️ **Digging in:** I started by removing the fairings, gas tank, and airbox to gain access to the valve cover. My thought was: let's verify the cam chain and check the valve clearances. This bike has an automatic cam chain tensioner, and I wanted to properly remove and inspect it. I also have a manual tensioner that will fit, so that was one of the first troubleshooting steps I wanted to try at this stage.\n\n🛠️ **Initial findings:** The cam chain tensioner looked fine, and the chain itself was tight and in good condition. I checked the valve clearances, and everything was within spec. So at this point, I was confident the issue wasn't coming from the cam chain or valve train.\n\n🔧 **Time to go deeper:** With the cam chain, tensioner, and valve clearances all checking out, I was running out of options—and getting a little frustrated. I had hoped it would be something simple, but the noise wasn't going away, and I didn't want to risk making things worse by running it again. At that point, I knew what I had to do: pull the engine and dig in for real.\n\n🧰 **Let's drop it:** I had my friend Joe come over, and we began the process of dropping the engine. Before we could even get to that point, though, we had to remove the fairings, gas tank, and airbox again to fully expose the engine and free up space to work. I took a ton of pictures along the way—especially of the wiring, hoses, and mounting points—since I knew I'd need good documentation for the reassembly later.\n\nThe engine removal itself went smoothly. Once it was out, we set it aside and got to work. We removed the valve cover, pulled the camshafts, and carefully removed the valve buckets along with the shims. When it came time to remove the cylinder head, I made sure to loosen the bolts in the correct sequence to avoid warping it. Taking the time to follow the proper order was critical—and something I didn't want to rush or guess on.\n\nWith all the bolts removed, we gently tapped the head to break it free. As we lifted it off, we almost immediately saw the issue. Yup—there it was.

Let me tell you - what we found was both exactly what I expected and completely shocking at the same time.\n\n## 💥 What We Found\n\nAs soon as we lifted the head, the problem was immediately obvious. The #4 cylinder piston had significant damage to the crown. There were deep gouges and what looked like impact marks around the edges. But here's the kicker - the cylinder walls themselves looked surprisingly good.\n\n**The Real Culprit:** After closer inspection, we discovered that the damage wasn't from a catastrophic failure, but from something much more insidious - carbon buildup that had broken loose and gotten trapped between the piston and head.\n\n## 🧠 Why This Happened\n\nThis bike had been running rich for who knows how long before I got it. The previous owner had done some \"performance mods\" that included a power commander, but the fueling was never properly tuned. Over time, this created excessive carbon buildup in the combustion chambers.\n\nWhen I started pushing the bike harder on track, the increased heat and pressure caused some of this carbon to break loose. Once it got trapped between the piston and head, it created those distinctive knocking sounds I was hearing.\n\n## 🔧 The Fix Plan\n\nThe good news is that this is totally repairable. Here's what we need to do:\n\n1. **Clean everything thoroughly** - Remove all carbon deposits\n2. **Inspect the piston** - Determine if it needs replacement or just cleaning\n3. **Check valve seats** - Make sure they're not damaged\n4. **Reassemble with proper torque specs**\n5. **Address the root cause** - Get the fueling properly tuned\n\n## 💡 Lessons Learned\n\nThis whole experience taught me a valuable lesson about buying used race bikes. Even if the bike runs well initially, you never know what's lurking beneath the surface. The previous owner's \"improvements\" actually created the problem that eventually sidelined me.\n\n**Key Takeaway:** Always get a proper tune after any fueling modifications, and don't assume that \"it runs fine\" means everything is actually fine.\n\n## 🛠️ Next Steps\n\nIn Part 3, I'll walk through the actual repair process - cleaning, inspection, and reassembly.

Between privacy concerns, recurring subscription costs, and the desire to learn more about Linux administration, building a home server became the perfect project.\n\n## 🛠️ The Hardware Setup\n\nI started with a **Raspberry Pi 4 Model B** (8GB RAM) - the perfect balance of power and affordability. Here's what I paired it with:\n\n- **Storage**: 1TB Samsung T7 SSD (external)\n- **Power**: Official Raspberry Pi power supply\n- **Case**: Flirc aluminum case for passive cooling\n- **Network**: Gigabit Ethernet connection\n\n## 🐧 Operating System Choice\n\nI went with **Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS** instead of Raspberry Pi OS. Here's why:\n\n- **Better package support** for server applications\n- **Longer support cycle** (5 years vs 2 years)\n- **More familiar** for someone coming from desktop Ubuntu\n- **Better Docker support**\n\n## 📦 Essential Services I'm Running\n\n### 1. **Plex Media Server**\n\n- Streams my movie/TV collection to any device\n- Automatic metadata fetching\n- Hardware transcoding (limited on Pi, but works for 1080p)\n\n### 2. **Nextcloud**\n\n- Personal cloud storage replacement\n- File sync across all devices\n- Calendar and contact sync\n\n### 3. **Pi-hole**\n\n- Network-wide ad blocking\n- DNS server for the entire home network\n- Beautiful web interface for monitoring\n\n### 4. **Home Assistant**\n\n- Smart home automation hub\n- Integrates with all my IoT devices\n- Custom automations for daily routines\n\n## 🔧 Configuration Highlights\n\n### Docker Setup\n\n```bash\n# Install Docker\ncurl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh\nsudo sh get-docker.sh\n\n# Add user to docker group\nsudo usermod -aG docker $USER\n```\n\n### Automatic Backups\n\nI set up a cron job that creates daily snapshots of my Nextcloud data and syncs them to an external drive.\n\n### Network Configuration\n\n- Static IP assignment\n- Port forwarding for external access\n- SSL certificates with Let's Encrypt\n\n## 💡 Lessons Learned\n\n1. **Start Simple**: Don't try to run everything at once. Add services gradually.\n2. **Backup Everything**: RAID isn't backup. Have multiple backup strategies.\n3. **Monitor Resources**: The Pi has limits. Keep an eye on CPU, RAM, and storage.\n4. **Security First**: Change default passwords, use SSH keys, keep systems updated.\n\n## 🚀 Performance Results\n\nFor a $50 computer, I'm amazed at what this little Pi can handle:\n\n- **Plex**: Streams 1080p content to 2-3 devices simultaneously\n- **Nextcloud**: Handles file sync for 3 users without breaking a sweat\n- **Pi-hole**: Blocks ~30% of DNS requests (ads/tracking)\n- **Home Assistant**: Manages 15+ smart devices with complex automations\n\n## 🔮 Future Plans\n\n- Add a second Pi for redundancy\n- Implement automated backup verification\n- Set up a reverse proxy for better SSL management\n- Add monitoring with Grafana/Prometheus\n\nThe Raspberry Pi home server has been one of my most rewarding projects. It's taught me so much about Linux administration, networking, and self-hosting.

The tipping point came when I was debugging a complex React component and spent hours tracking down a bug that would have been caught immediately with proper typing.\n\n## 🚀 The Learning Curve\n\n### Week 1: Basic Types\n\nStarted with the fundamentals - strings, numbers, booleans, arrays. The syntax felt familiar but the mental model took some getting used to.\n\n```typescript\n// JavaScript way\nfunction greet(name) {\n  return `Hello, ${name}!`;\n}\n\n// TypeScript way\nfunction greet(name: string): string {\n  return `Hello, ${name}!`;\n}\n```\n\n### Week 2: Interfaces and Types\n\nThis is where TypeScript really started to shine. Creating interfaces for my data structures made my code so much more readable and maintainable.\n\n```typescript\ninterface User {\n  id: number;\n  name: string;\n  email: string;\n  isActive: boolean;\n}\n\nfunction createUser(userData: User): User {\n  // TypeScript ensures I handle all required properties\n  return {\n    id: userData.id,\n    name: userData.name,\n    email: userData.email,\n    isActive: userData.isActive,\n  };\n}\n```\n\n### Week 3: Generics\n\nThis was the hardest concept to wrap my head around, but once I got it, it opened up a whole new world of possibilities.\n\n```typescript\nfunction createArray\u003CT>(length: number, value: T): T[] {\n  return Array(length).fill(value);\n}\n\n// Usage\nconst stringArray = createArray\u003Cstring>(3, \"hello\");\nconst numberArray = createArray\u003Cnumber>(5, 42);\n```\n\n## 💡 Key Benefits I've Discovered\n\n### 1. **Better IDE Support**\n\n- Autocomplete that actually works\n- Refactoring tools that don't break things\n- Real-time error detection\n\n### 2. **Self-Documenting Code**\n\n- Function signatures tell you exactly what they expect\n- No more guessing what properties an object has\n- Clear contracts between components\n\n### 3. **Catch Bugs Early**\n\n- Type errors at compile time instead of runtime\n- Prevents common mistakes like typos in property names\n- Ensures API contracts are followed\n\n### 4. **Better Refactoring**\n\n- Rename a property and TypeScript shows you everywhere it needs to be updated\n- Change a function signature and get immediate feedback on all callers\n- Confidence to make big changes without breaking things\n\n## 🛠️ Practical Tips for Beginners\n\n### 1. **Start Small**\n\nDon't try to convert your entire codebase at once. Start with new files or small modules.\n\n### 2. **Use `any` Sparingly**\n\nIt's tempting to use `any` to bypass type errors, but it defeats the purpose. Use `unknown` instead when you're not sure of the type.\n\n### 3. **Leverage Type Inference**\n\nTypeScript is smart enough to infer many types automatically. Don't over-annotate.\n\n```typescript\n// Let TypeScript infer the return type\nfunction add(a: number, b: number) {\n  return a + b; // TypeScript knows this returns number\n}\n```\n\n### 4. **Use Utility Types**\n\nTypeScript provides powerful utility types that can save you a lot of time:\n\n```typescript\ninterface User {\n  id: number;\n  name: string;\n  email: string;\n  password: string;\n}\n\n// Create a type without the password field\ntype PublicUser = Omit\u003CUser, \"password\">;\n\n// Make all properties optional\ntype PartialUser = Partial\u003CUser>;\n```\n\n## 🔧 Integration with Existing Projects\n\n### Gradual Migration Strategy\n\n1. **Enable TypeScript** with `allowJs: true` in `tsconfig.json`\n2. **Rename files** from `.js` to `.ts` one at a time\n3. **Add type annotations** incrementally\n4. **Use JSDoc comments** for existing JavaScript files\n\n### Configuration Tips\n\n```json\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"strict\": true,\n    \"noImplicitAny\": true,\n    \"strictNullChecks\": true,\n    \"allowJs\": true,\n    \"checkJs\": true\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## 🎉 Results After 3 Months\n\n- **Bug reduction**: ~70% fewer runtime errors\n- **Development speed**: Faster once I got used to the workflow\n- **Code confidence**: Much more comfortable making changes\n- **Team collaboration**: Easier to understand other people's code\n\n## 🚀 Next Steps\n\nI'm now exploring:\n\n- **Advanced TypeScript patterns** like conditional types\n- **Framework integration** with React, Vue, and Node.js\n- **Performance optimization** techniques\n- **Testing strategies** with typed test utilities\n\n## 💭 Final Thoughts\n\nLearning TypeScript has been one of the best decisions I've made for my development career. The initial learning curve was steep, but the long-term benefits are enormous. It's not just about catching bugs - it's about writing better, more maintainable code.\n\n**If you're on the fence about TypeScript, just start. You won't regret it.**\n\nThe investment in learning TypeScript pays dividends every day I write code. It's like having a super-smart pair programming partner that never gets tired and catches all the mistakes I might miss.","src/content/blog/learning-typescript-in-2025.md","1095c820cbca0474",{"html":176,"metadata":177},"\u003Ch2 id=\"-why-typescript\">🎯 Why TypeScript?\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>After years of writing JavaScript, I finally decided to dive into TypeScript.
