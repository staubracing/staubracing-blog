In this post, I'll show you exactly what we found once the engine came apart—and what needs fixing.\n\nThe damage on cylinder #4 wasn't subtle. You could clearly see vertical scoring on both the front and rear sides of the bore, along with a polished section where the piston had been making contact. Since these are **Nikasil-coated cylinders**, this kind of damage isn't something you can just hone out. The coating is extremely hard but very thin—once it's compromised, your options are limited to either re-plating or replacement.\n\n\u003CMediaDisplay \n  src=\"/images/blog/racing/zx6r-engine-rebuild/scoring-on-cylinder-1.jpg\" \n  alt=\"Scoring on Cylinder #4\" \n  caption=\"Vertical scoring visible on both sides of cylinder #4 bore, with polished sections where piston contact occurred and the piston had been rubbing against the bore. Which deposited aluminum on the bore.\"\n/>\n\nSeeing this was a double-edged moment. I was relieved to have found the cause of the noise—it wasn't in my head—but also bummed to be staring at real damage. I had no idea what the total cost would be or how deep this rebuild might go. But I was committed now. The engine was open, and there was no turning back. I was going to rebuild this engine! I was going to get it back to the track and race it!\n\n\u003CMediaDisplay \n  src=\"/images/blog/racing/zx6r-engine-rebuild/clip-piston-slap.mp4\" \n  type=\"video\"\n  width=\"640px\"\n  caption=\"Once we got the head off and I could access the top of the piston, I could see what was causing the knocking noise. The piston was rubbing against the bore and the bore was scoring. This is what caused the knocking noise.\"\n/>\n\nOver the next few weeks, I chipped away at the teardown in stages. I started removing the external components: the starter, oil pump, radiator hoses going to the oil cooler, and the oil pan to drain everything and expose the lower end of the engine.\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"/images/blog/racing/zx6r-engine-rebuild/engine-parts.jpg\" alt=\"Test Image\" />\n\nWhen it came time to split the crankcase, I verified the proper bolt removal sequence using the service manual. These engines are tough, but skipping steps can cause warping or future sealing issues.\n\nAfter getting all the bolts out, I split the case and finally exposed the crankshaft and connecting rod end caps.\n\n\u003CMediaDisplay \n  src=\"/images/blog/racing/zx6r-engine-rebuild/engine-cases-split.png\" \n  alt=\"Cases Split Open\" \n  caption=\"Crankcase halves separated, revealing the crankshaft and connecting rod assemblies\"\n/>\n\nWith the cases apart, I removed the rod caps and slid out the rod bearings. Then I carefully pulled the crankshaft and inspected the main bearings underneath.\n\n\u003CMediaDisplay \n  src=\"/images/blog/racing/zx6r-engine-rebuild/engineout-1.jpg\" \n  alt=\"Engine Removed from Frame\" \n  caption=\"Engine removed from frame for complete disassembly and inspection\"\n/>\n\nSurprisingly, they looked good—no major scoring, no heat discoloration, and no embedded debris. That was a bit of good news. It meant the bottom end likely wasn't completely wrecked. The damage looked isolated to the top end and that #4 cylinder.\n\nThe piston from cylinder #4 confirmed this theory. It had significant damage along the sides, especially where it had been rocking in the bore. That rocking motion—called **piston slap**—is what likely caused the polished sections and scoring on the cylinder wall.\n\nPiston slap happens when there's too much clearance between the piston and cylinder wall, often due to wear or heat. Instead of moving straight up and down, the piston rocks slightly with each stroke. Over time, this repeated contact transfers aluminum from the piston onto the cylinder wall.\n\n\u003CMediaDisplay \n  src=\"/images/blog/racing/zx6r-engine-rebuild/engine-scroing.jpg\" \n  alt=\"Engine Cylinder Scoring\" \n  caption=\"Close-up view of cylinder scoring damage from piston slap\"\n/>\n\nSince this is a Nikasil surface, aluminum transfer like this can't just be honed out. It either needs to be chemically cleaned—there's an acid method I want to try—or fully re-plated by a machine shop.\n\n---\n\n🔧 **Next Up**: I'll be exploring cleaning options, talking to machine shops, and planning the repair path forward.

Third shift started at nine and, if we were lucky, ended around nine the next morning, but usually dragged closer to ten. The air smelled of jet fuel and exhaust, the kind of cold that made metal sting when you touched it.\n\nI started every night the same way — park outside the hangar, pull my collar up against the wind, and walk through the side door into the little office in back where the coffee pot hissed and the night's task sheets waited. The place always smelled like burnt grounds, cold air, and hydraulic fluid. That's where I grabbed my assignment and found out what kind of trouble I'd be babysitting till sunrise.\n\nKevin — or K-Dog, as everyone called him — was a farmer from International Falls, Minnesota. He had that mechanical sense you only get when things break forty miles from the nearest toolbox. Out in the fields, if a tractor quit, you didn't call for parts — you made it work with what you had. That mindset followed him onto the ramp. He lived on Mountain Dew and Copenhagen, swore at airplanes like they could hear him, and somehow kept them in the air. Give him a problem, a crescent wrench, and a bad idea, and he'd have that piece of shit running again before sunrise.\n\nThat night, we drew a 727-200 with an erratic fuel-flow issue — easy job, just messy as hell sometimes. We loaded the truck with toolboxes, a spare transmitter, and our standard survival kit — coffee strong enough to strip paint, a couple bottles of Mountain Dew, and enough smokes to fog the hangar. The dashboard was a mess of logbooks, menthol cigarettes, and empty Copenhagen cans sliding around as we bounced across the ramp toward the airplane.\n\nKevin killed the engine and popped the door.\n\n\"You grab the transmitter?\" he asked, already knowing I had.\n\"No, I left it at the hangar, dumbass,\" I shot back. \"Of course I grabbed it.\"\nHe just grinned — the kind of grin that said _same shit, different night_.\n\nThe talk was always rough, the kind of banter you'd hear in a kitchen at rush hour. Outsiders might've thought we hated each other, but it was the opposite. That back-and-forth was respect in our world, a bond built from too many long nights and close calls. You could trust a guy who'd call you an that would make a sailor blush and still hand you the wrench before you asked.\n\nWe hauled our toolboxes down, boots crunching on ice and grit, the smell of jet fuel thick enough to taste. Somewhere off in the distance an APU whined, a reminder that the rest of the airport was still alive and moving freight while we froze our asses off\nK-Dog and I were usually the problem solvers — the ones called when something refused to cooperate. The rest of the overnight work fell to a gang of contractors from the, at-the-time, bankrupt Sun Country Airlines. They handled the basic checks — periodic service inspections, PS checks, the routine stuff. Good enough hands, but they didn’t know our airplanes the way we did. Every now and then one of them would wander over, eager to “help,” and that’s usually when the fun began.\n\nI pulled the truck under the number-three engine and started opening the cowlings, digging in. Each of our trucks had what we called surfboards on top — steel platforms welded to the bed and frame that stretched out over the cab of the old GMC 1500 Sierras. They were built for reaching the engines and gave us just enough height to work without dragging out a maintenance stand. It wasn’t fancy, but it got the job done.\n\nI was halfway through pulling panels when I spotted some movement out of the corner of my eye. One of the Sun Country contractors was circling the aircraft, clipboard in hand, pretending to look busy. Great, I thought, now I get to help this asshole too. The last thing we needed was another body in the way, especially one who didn’t know our airplane.\n\nI started digging into pulling the old transmitter, ready to get after it. I sent K-Dog up to the cockpit to pull the fuel shutoff handle and cut the supply to the engine. With that pulled, the fuel system’s isolated — this baby won’t start without the go juice. You still get a shot of fuel that’s left in the lines, and it’s damn near impossible not to end up with your hands covered in Jet-A.\nKevin came back to see if I needed a hand, and I told him to just be my moral support and maybe give me a back rub. He laughed and said, “How about I give you a rub and a tug while I smoke and watch you do all the work?” I flipped him off and went back to wrestling with the fuel line. Same routine every night. While I was installing the new fuel-flow transmitter, I asked Kevin what the other shitheads were up to.\n\n“The dumbass is up in the cockpit,” he said over the intercom. “Looks like he’s poking around, asking what we’re working on.”\nI rolled my eyes. “Perfect. Last thing I need is a helper.”\nKevin chuckled. “Yeah, he’s got that ‘I’m here to help’ look.”\n\nI could hear him up there talking with the guy, some small talk over the radio. I didn’t think much of it, just figured the contractor was curious, maybe trying to look useful. The job was simple, just messy, and I was almost ready to button everything up. As long as he stayed out of the way, we’d be done in no time.\n\nI sent Kevin to the cockpit and told him, “Fire this fucker up!” We both knew the drill with this kind of part change. The fuel lines were drained, and it would take a while for fuel to reach the fuel controller, think of it like a carburetor or fuel injection system, but for a jet engine.  \nThe starter whined, spooling up like a turbine hair dryer, but I knew it’d take a minute before she caught fuel. I was inches from the engine and could see the fuel-control rod slide into place — that meant Kevin had switched on the fuel flow, right on cue.\n\nBut we weren’t getting light-off — no signs of the engine spooling up toward idle. After a few seconds, I told Kevin to kill it. With all the noise, radios were useless anyway. Guys like Kevin and me had an unspoken language. I grabbed the fuel-control rod and gave it a shake — our signal. I knew Kevin was several yards away in the cockpit, his hand resting on the fuel shutoff lever, waiting for that exact move.\n\nJust as I reached my hand toward the lever, thinking to myself, What the hell did I screw up? — the whole area lit up like a lightning bolt went off. A chest-thumping boom followed that damn near made me shit my pants. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw a blast of blue and orange flame shoot at least thirty feet out the tailpipe.\n\nI immediately felt like the biggest idiot. No hesitation, no excuses, just that voice in my head going, You stupid fuck, what did you forget to do this time?\n\nScrambling to get my senses back, I realized the engine was running smooth at idle. Well, fuck it! I’m here now; might as well make sure I don’t have any leaks.\n\nOnce I knew things at the engine were under control, I saw the fuel-control rod return to the shutoff position and knew Kevin was shutting it down. Damn, that dude knows me too well — he could tell I wasn’t panicking and that I was just doing a leak check.\n\nThese are the people you want on your team — the ones who know what you need and when you need it, without a single word said.\n\nI climbed off the truck, made my way up the aft airstair, and headed for the cockpit. Kevin was already standing in the doorway, and I could tell he was pissed. The thing about Kevin, though — when he’s pissed, he doesn’t yell or turn red. He just smiles, and that’s how you know it’s bad.\n\nI wasn’t even halfway up the row of those typical blue-covered seats when I called out, “What the fuck was that?”\nI looked at him and said, “Why did you fucking pull it in the first place?”\nHe shrugged. “Well, I didn’t want the engine to accidentally start while you were working on it.”\nI just stared at him. “Accidentally start? Really? What — we’d accidentally fire up the APU for bleed air, accidentally hit the start switch, accidentally move the fuel shutoff to run, and just sit back while the jet lights itself off?”\n\nThe sarcasm wasn’t lost on anyone. Even Kevin cracked a grin. The sarcasm wasn’t lost on anyone. Even Kevin cracked a grin. He always got a kick out of watching me “do my thing,” as he liked to call it — meaning when I really let someone have it. He’s been known to let me off the leash now and then, just to make a point.\n\nI’ve been called an asshole more than once, and fair enough — sometimes you have to be. There are ramp rats and bag smashers out there so clueless you’ve got to make sure they understand, usually with a very specific tone of, Are you fucking kidding me?\n\nBy the time the paperwork was done and the ramp lights started to fade into dawn, it already felt like another story no one would believe. Just another night, another near-miss, another reason to wonder why we kept coming back.\n\nBut that’s the thing about this life — you don’t do it for the glory or the paycheck. You do it because you can’t stand not knowing what broke, or how to make it run again.

Unfortunately, during the third round of the season—only my second race with the bike—the engine started making a knocking noise during Saturday morning practice.\n\n\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: center; margin: 2rem 0;\">\n  \u003Cimg \n    src=\"/images/blog/racing/zx6r-engine-rebuild/zx6r-track-day.jpg\" \n    alt=\"My ZX6R at the track before the engine issues\" \n    style=\"max-width: 100%; height: auto; border: 3px solid #e0e0e0; border-radius: 12px; transition: transform 0.3s ease, box-shadow 0.3s ease;\" \n    onmouseover=\"this.style.transform='scale(1.02)'; this.style.boxShadow='0 8px 25px rgba(0,0,0,0.2)'\"\n    onmouseout=\"this.style.transform='scale(1)'; this.style.boxShadow='none'\"\n  />\n\u003C/div>\n\nRight away, I pitted and started trying to figure out what was going on. I fired the bike back up and listened carefully. The noise sounded like a rattle—subtle, but definitely not normal. A few people came over to listen and tossed around their guesses, everything from cam chain rattle to a spun rod bearing. At that point, I knew I had a real problem on my hands, and racing that weekend was off the table.\n\nI'm writing this to share my experience taking on this project—and hopefully motivate someone else to find the confidence to do the same.\n\n## 💬 What Happened / What I Learned\n\nI started with some high-level troubleshooting to figure out what the noise was and where it was coming from. The sound was definitely coming from the right side of the engine, which led me to believe it might be a cam chain issue.\n\nA few people at the track were convinced it was a main rod bearing. But by using the old screwdriver-to-the-ear trick—the classic \"poor man's stethoscope\"—I was able to narrow the noise down to the #4 cylinder area, right around where the cam chain sits.\n\n🛠️ **Digging in:** I started by removing the fairings, gas tank, and airbox to gain access to the valve cover. My thought was: let's verify the cam chain and check the valve clearances. This bike has an automatic cam chain tensioner, and I wanted to properly remove and inspect it. I also have a manual tensioner that will fit, so that was one of the first troubleshooting steps I wanted to try at this stage.\n\n🛠️ **Initial findings:** The cam chain tensioner looked fine, and the chain itself was tight and in good condition. I checked the valve clearances, and everything was within spec. So at this point, I was confident the issue wasn't coming from the cam chain or valve train.\n\n🔧 **Time to go deeper:** With the cam chain, tensioner, and valve clearances all checking out, I was running out of options—and getting a little frustrated. I had hoped it would be something simple, but the noise wasn't going away, and I didn't want to risk making things worse by running it again. At that point, I knew what I had to do: pull the engine and dig in for real.\n\n🧰 **Let's drop it:** I had my friend Joe come over, and we began the process of dropping the engine. Before we could even get to that point, though, we had to remove the fairings, gas tank, and airbox again to fully expose the engine and free up space to work. I took a ton of pictures along the way—especially of the wiring, hoses, and mounting points—since I knew I'd need good documentation for the reassembly later.\n\n\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: center; margin: 2rem 0;\">\n  \u003Cimg \n    src=\"/images/blog/racing/zx6r-engine-rebuild/drop-prep.jpg\" \n    alt=\"My ZX6R at the track before the engine issues\" \n    style=\"max-width: 100%; height: auto; border: 3px solid #e0e0e0; border-radius: 12px; transition: transform 0.3s ease, box-shadow 0.3s ease;\" \n    onmouseover=\"this.style.transform='scale(1.02)'; this.style.boxShadow='0 8px 25px rgba(0,0,0,0.2)'\"\n    onmouseout=\"this.style.transform='scale(1)'; this.style.boxShadow='none'\"\n  />\n\u003C/div>\n\n### 📸 Engine Removal Process\n\n\u003Cdiv style=\"display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr; gap: 1rem; margin: 2rem 0;\">\n  \u003Cimg src=\"/images/blog/racing/zx6r-engine-rebuild/engine-drop.jpg\" alt=\"Engine removal step 1\" />\n  \u003Cimg src=\"/images/blog/racing/zx6r-engine-rebuild/engine-removal-2.jpg\" alt=\"Engine removal step 2\" />\n  \u003Cimg src=\"/images/blog/racing/zx6r-engine-rebuild/engine-removal-3.jpg\" alt=\"Engine removal step 3\" />\n  \u003Cimg src=\"/images/blog/racing/zx6r-engine-rebuild/engine-removal-4.jpg\" alt=\"Engine removal step 4\" />\n\u003C/div>\n\nThe engine removal itself went smoothly.

Between privacy concerns, recurring subscription costs, and the desire to learn more about Linux administration, building a home server became the perfect project.\n\n## 🛠️ The Hardware Setup\n\nI started with a **Raspberry Pi 4 Model B** (8GB RAM) - the perfect balance of power and affordability. Here's what I paired it with:\n\n- **Storage**: 1TB Samsung T7 SSD (external)\n- **Power**: Official Raspberry Pi power supply\n- **Case**: Flirc aluminum case for passive cooling\n- **Network**: Gigabit Ethernet connection\n\n## 🐧 Operating System Choice\n\nI went with **Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS** instead of Raspberry Pi OS. Here's why:\n\n- **Better package support** for server applications\n- **Longer support cycle** (5 years vs 2 years)\n- **More familiar** for someone coming from desktop Ubuntu\n- **Better Docker support**\n\n## 📦 Essential Services I'm Running\n\n### 1. **Plex Media Server**\n\n- Streams my movie/TV collection to any device\n- Automatic metadata fetching\n- Hardware transcoding (limited on Pi, but works for 1080p)\n\n### 2. **Nextcloud**\n\n- Personal cloud storage replacement\n- File sync across all devices\n- Calendar and contact sync\n\n### 3. **Pi-hole**\n\n- Network-wide ad blocking\n- DNS server for the entire home network\n- Beautiful web interface for monitoring\n\n### 4. **Home Assistant**\n\n- Smart home automation hub\n- Integrates with all my IoT devices\n- Custom automations for daily routines\n\n## 🔧 Configuration Highlights\n\n### Docker Setup\n\n```bash\n# Install Docker\ncurl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh\nsudo sh get-docker.sh\n\n# Add user to docker group\nsudo usermod -aG docker $USER\n```\n\n### Automatic Backups\n\nI set up a cron job that creates daily snapshots of my Nextcloud data and syncs them to an external drive.\n\n### Network Configuration\n\n- Static IP assignment\n- Port forwarding for external access\n- SSL certificates with Let's Encrypt\n\n## 💡 Lessons Learned\n\n1. **Start Simple**: Don't try to run everything at once. Add services gradually.\n2. **Backup Everything**: RAID isn't backup. Have multiple backup strategies.\n3. **Monitor Resources**: The Pi has limits. Keep an eye on CPU, RAM, and storage.\n4. **Security First**: Change default passwords, use SSH keys, keep systems updated.\n\n## 🚀 Performance Results\n\nFor a $50 computer, I'm amazed at what this little Pi can handle:\n\n- **Plex**: Streams 1080p content to 2-3 devices simultaneously\n- **Nextcloud**: Handles file sync for 3 users without breaking a sweat\n- **Pi-hole**: Blocks ~30% of DNS requests (ads/tracking)\n- **Home Assistant**: Manages 15+ smart devices with complex automations\n\n## 🔮 Future Plans\n\n- Add a second Pi for redundancy\n- Implement automated backup verification\n- Set up a reverse proxy for better SSL management\n- Add monitoring with Grafana/Prometheus\n\nThe Raspberry Pi home server has been one of my most rewarding projects.

The tipping point came when I was debugging a complex React component and spent hours tracking down a bug that would have been caught immediately with proper typing.\n\n## 🚀 The Learning Curve\n\n### Week 1: Basic Types\n\nStarted with the fundamentals - strings, numbers, booleans, arrays. The syntax felt familiar but the mental model took some getting used to.\n\n```typescript\n// JavaScript way\nfunction greet(name) {\n  return `Hello, ${name}!`;\n}\n\n// TypeScript way\nfunction greet(name: string): string {\n  return `Hello, ${name}!`;\n}\n```\n\n### Week 2: Interfaces and Types\n\nThis is where TypeScript really started to shine. Creating interfaces for my data structures made my code so much more readable and maintainable.\n\n```typescript\ninterface User {\n  id: number;\n  name: string;\n  email: string;\n  isActive: boolean;\n}\n\nfunction createUser(userData: User): User {\n  // TypeScript ensures I handle all required properties\n  return {\n    id: userData.id,\n    name: userData.name,\n    email: userData.email,\n    isActive: userData.isActive,\n  };\n}\n```\n\n### Week 3: Generics\n\nThis was the hardest concept to wrap my head around, but once I got it, it opened up a whole new world of possibilities.\n\n```typescript\nfunction createArray\u003CT>(length: number, value: T): T[] {\n  return Array(length).fill(value);\n}\n\n// Usage\nconst stringArray = createArray\u003Cstring>(3, \"hello\");\nconst numberArray = createArray\u003Cnumber>(5, 42);\n```\n\n## 💡 Key Benefits I've Discovered\n\n### 1. **Better IDE Support**\n\n- Autocomplete that actually works\n- Refactoring tools that don't break things\n- Real-time error detection\n\n### 2. **Self-Documenting Code**\n\n- Function signatures tell you exactly what they expect\n- No more guessing what properties an object has\n- Clear contracts between components\n\n### 3. **Catch Bugs Early**\n\n- Type errors at compile time instead of runtime\n- Prevents common mistakes like typos in property names\n- Ensures API contracts are followed\n\n### 4. **Better Refactoring**\n\n- Rename a property and TypeScript shows you everywhere it needs to be updated\n- Change a function signature and get immediate feedback on all callers\n- Confidence to make big changes without breaking things\n\n## 🛠️ Practical Tips for Beginners\n\n### 1. **Start Small**\n\nDon't try to convert your entire codebase at once. Start with new files or small modules.\n\n### 2. **Use `any` Sparingly**\n\nIt's tempting to use `any` to bypass type errors, but it defeats the purpose. Use `unknown` instead when you're not sure of the type.\n\n### 3. **Leverage Type Inference**\n\nTypeScript is smart enough to infer many types automatically. Don't over-annotate.\n\n```typescript\n// Let TypeScript infer the return type\nfunction add(a: number, b: number) {\n  return a + b; // TypeScript knows this returns number\n}\n```\n\n### 4. **Use Utility Types**\n\nTypeScript provides powerful utility types that can save you a lot of time:\n\n```typescript\ninterface User {\n  id: number;\n  name: string;\n  email: string;\n  password: string;\n}\n\n// Create a type without the password field\ntype PublicUser = Omit\u003CUser, \"password\">;\n\n// Make all properties optional\ntype PartialUser = Partial\u003CUser>;\n```\n\n## 🔧 Integration with Existing Projects\n\n### Gradual Migration Strategy\n\n1. **Enable TypeScript** with `allowJs: true` in `tsconfig.json`\n2. **Rename files** from `.js` to `.ts` one at a time\n3. **Add type annotations** incrementally\n4. **Use JSDoc comments** for existing JavaScript files\n\n### Configuration Tips\n\n```json\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"strict\": true,\n    \"noImplicitAny\": true,\n    \"strictNullChecks\": true,\n    \"allowJs\": true,\n    \"checkJs\": true\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## 🎉 Results After 3 Months\n\n- **Bug reduction**: ~70% fewer runtime errors\n- **Development speed**: Faster once I got used to the workflow\n- **Code confidence**: Much more comfortable making changes\n- **Team collaboration**: Easier to understand other people's code\n\n## 🚀 Next Steps\n\nI'm now exploring:\n\n- **Advanced TypeScript patterns** like conditional types\n- **Framework integration** with React, Vue, and Node.js\n- **Performance optimization** techniques\n- **Testing strategies** with typed test utilities\n\n## 💭 Final Thoughts\n\nLearning TypeScript has been one of the best decisions I've made for my development career. The initial learning curve was steep, but the long-term benefits are enormous. It's not just about catching bugs - it's about writing better, more maintainable code.\n\n**If you're on the fence about TypeScript, just start. You won't regret it.**\n\nThe investment in learning TypeScript pays dividends every day I write code. It's like having a super-smart pair programming partner that never gets tired and catches all the mistakes I might miss.","src/content/blog/code/learning-typescript-in-2025.md","1095c820cbca0474",{"html":181,"metadata":182},"\u003Ch2 id=\"-why-typescript\">🎯 Why TypeScript?\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>After years of writing JavaScript, I finally decided to dive into TypeScript.
