# Staub Racing

A personal site built with Astro 5, featuring motorcycle racing content, coding projects, DIY builds, and life updates. Deployed at [staubracing.com](https://staubracing.com).

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Start development server (http://localhost:4321)
yarn dev

# Build for production
yarn build

# Preview production build
yarn preview

# TypeScript validation
yarn astro check
```

## Deployment

Automatic via GitHub Actions on push to `main`:
- Builds with `astro build`
- Syncs `dist/` to AWS S3
- Invalidates CloudFront cache

No manual deploy command needed — just `git push`.

## Creating Content

Use the `/new-post` skill to scaffold a new blog post:

```bash
# In Claude Code
/new-post
```

Or manually create a markdown file in `src/content/blog/{category}/` with required frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: "Post Title"
date: 2026-02-22
tags: ["tag1", "tag2"]
category: racing
draft: false
---
```
